- Many to many between student and course


Learnings

- CascadeType.REMOVE should not be set (ALL can be set) in order to be able to delete an entity by cascade. E.g. in @ManyToMany mapping of courses in student, if we need to delete student using session.delete(), 
setting cascadetype.all will not work - deleted entity will be resaved.
